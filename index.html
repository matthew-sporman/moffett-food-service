                    <p>Moffett Food Service is one of the oldest family-owned
                        businesses in Flint Michigan today; it is currently owned and run by
                        the fifth generation of Moffett's. The Moffett family originated in
                        Scotland. The founder, Samuel Moffett, arrived in Flint in 1865
                        when he was just nine years old. To earn some extra money, Sam
                        peddled apples and peaches on the streets every day after school.
                        Recognizing Samuels’ uncanny ability and good judgment for values
                        and prices, his parents soon delegated him in charge of buying all
                        the household goods. This brought him in contact with the grocery
                        merchants in the city. At the age of sixteen, Sam began to work with Van Epps, Baily & Company, and then Carmen
                        & Smith Company.

            <div class = "moffett-sons">
                    <p> In 1879, after five years of experience, Sam leased the basement room of the F. W Judd building which
                        had both front and rear entrance for the purpose of buying and shipping farm produce to lumber camps in Bay City
                        and Saginaw. From this endeavor, he saved $360 and with it formed a partnership with L.M. Bray to conduct a
                        retail grocery business—Bray & Moffett. The partnership ended two years later, and Sam started his own store. He
                        moved several times but by 1903 he
                        was firmly established in the wholesale
                        and retail grocery business. By 1910,
                        they discontinued the produce line and
                        operated a grocery and coal business.
                        At this time, the name of the business
                        became Moffett & Sons, run by Sam
                        Moffett and his two sons, Robert G.
                        Moffett and Sam B. Moffett.

            <div class = "sam-l-moffett-grocer">
                    <p> On January 9, 1012, the warehouse
                        caught fire, becoming one of the largest fires in Flint’s history with damages amounting to
                        a total loss of $84,000. The family was not finished yet, for in 1913 they built a new
                        building between Brush and Harrison Streets.
                        In 1916, the firm joined Symons Brothers of
                        Saginaw with the purpose of expanding the
                        business. The firm’s name changed again to
                        Moffett Grocer Co in 1924. In 1928, the company
                        became the largest wholesale grocer in the
                        Midwest, having a total of 90,000 square feet of
                        floor space. It remained Moffett Grocer Co. until
                        1952, under the leadership of the two sons
                        Robert G. Moffett and Sam B. Moffett and into
                        the third generation—Russell Moffett, Marge
                        Moffett, and Robert S. Moffett.

                        In 1952, Robert S. Moffett bought out the family
                        interest and changed the name to Iris Tea Company, becoming strictly a restaurant institutional wholesaler. The
                        Name Iris Tea was chosen because R.G. Moffett had 250 plus varieties of Iris flowers at his home on Lake Fenton.
                        Robert developed the business until it outgrew its location at Lewis Street, and with the help of the fourth
                        generation, Robert (Bruce) Moffett, Jeff Moffett, and Barbara Moffett-Boyles, the company moved to its present ocation 145 W. Lakeview in 1972.
                        Currently the business is running strong due to the efforts of the fifth generation; Brian Moffett, Jennifer
                        Moffett and Eric Moffett. Word of mouth spread of our fair prices, friendly customer service, and ability to deliver
                        on time. Today we are looking to modernize our business and find ways to spread the word of our amazing history,
                        customer service, and wholesale services.
